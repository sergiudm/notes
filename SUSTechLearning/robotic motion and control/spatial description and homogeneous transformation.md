## Notation
## frame
a coordinate system, {A}, with three mutually
orthogonal unit vectors.
## position
 a point ${}^A P$ is represented as a vector and
can equivalently be thought of as a position in space.
Individual elements of a vector are given the subscripts x, y, and z:
$$
{}^AP = \begin{bmatrix}
p_x \\
p_y \\
p_z
\end{bmatrix}
$$

## orientation
${}^A_B R$:
