## Description of position, orientation, and frame
### Position vector
$$
\mathbb{P}=\begin{bmatrix}
p_x \\
p_y \\
P_z
\end{bmatrix}
$$
### Orientation vector
Given {A}, the orientation of the 3D object can be described by {B}, i.e. by three unit vectors along its principal axes, in relation to {A}:
