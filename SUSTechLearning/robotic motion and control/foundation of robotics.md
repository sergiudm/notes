## Introduction
### Analysis
#### Zero-order analysis: (forward)kinematics & inverse kinematics
> Kinematics: given a robot manipulator (arm) with a specific configuration(joint angles), find the position and orientation of the robot arm end-effector (tip)

>Inverse kinematics: given desired position and orientation of the end-effector, find the set of possible joint angles which support such position and orientation

Eg. 1
$$p_x=l_1cos(\theta_1)+l_2cos(\theta_2) 
$$
